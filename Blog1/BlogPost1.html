    <h1>How to Change a Car Tire</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px;">Everyone should know how to do this!!!</p>
  </div>

  <p>Switching a tire on a car is very easy to do almost anyone can do it. It is a very important skill to have. If you ever get stranded on a road with a flat tire, you will know exactly what to do after reading
    this blog post. Changing a tire takes roughly 15 minutes to do. The best condition to change a car tire in, is if all four wheels are on flat surfaces and you are not in the middle of the road. If you are on the road, turn on your hazard lights and avoid changing
    your car's tire on soft ground and hills.

  <h4>Here are the basic steps:</h4>
  <ul>
      <li>First, shift your car into park and push the emergency brake.</li>
      <li>If you have any heavy objects, place them in front and behind the wheels that are not flat.
      <ul>
          <li>This will prevent the car from rolling un expectedly.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Next, you need to be able to identify where your car holds its spare tire and emergency jack.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Most cars have them in the rear trunk and trucks have them under the bed in the back.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Place the jack under the frame of the car. Make sure it is on the metal and not any other material</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Also make sure the jack is perpendicular to the frame and the ground</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lift the jack slightly so it is supporting (but not lifting) the vehicle</li>
      <li>Losen the wheel's lug nuts by using the wrench that came with your car turning counter clockwise. Do not take them off all the way just yet.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>This is a difficult part because some lug nuts are very hard to loosen. Use your body weight to your advantage.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Raise the jack so the wheel comes off the ground</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Make sure to keep an eye on the vehicle's stability. If it appears to become unstable when you are raising the jack, put the car back down and try again.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now, remove the lug nuts the rest of the way</li>
      <li>The tire can now be removed. If it appears to be stuck, use a rubber mallet to gently knock it loose.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Do not be too rough with the tire because it could cause the car to become unstable on the jack it's on.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Now it's time to reverse the process. Put the spare tire on the hub.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Be sure to put the tire on the correct way and not backwards. The valve stem should be facing outwards.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Put the lug nuts back on and tighten them all by hand first until they feel snug.</li>
      <li>After that, use the wrench to tighten them using a star pattern.</li>
      <ul>
          <li>If you tighten the nuts in a circle, it could cause the tire to not be as secured as it should be.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Lower your car back down so the tire takes the weight of the car</li>
      <ul>
          <li>Tighten up the nuts if necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Put the old tire and other supplies back into your car</li>

      <p>And there you go! Changing a car tire is simply and easy!</p>
